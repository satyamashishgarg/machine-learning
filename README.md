# machine-learning
Here's a machine learning program using Python. This program demonstrates the process of training a simple linear regression model on a dataset and making predictions

In this example, you need to replace 'data.csv' with the actual path to your dataset file. The program loads the dataset, splits it into features (X) and the target variable (y), and then splits the data into training and test sets. It creates a linear regression model using LinearRegression() from scikit-learn, trains the model on the training data, and makes predictions on the test set. Finally, it evaluates the model's performance using the R-squared score and demonstrates how to use the trained model to make predictions on new data
